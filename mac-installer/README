Following the suggestions at 
http://www.osxgnu.org/info/osxpackages.html, here is a directory 
structure that will be used for generating an OS X installer package.

Note that the panel itself is installed to /tmp/ first and then moved
to the right place by a shell script in the PostFlight.

NOTE! You must manually copy the CreativeCommonsPanel-2007.txt into 
Package_Root/tmp/.
