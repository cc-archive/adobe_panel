Following the suggestions at 
http://www.osxgnu.org/info/osxpackages.html, here is a directory 
structure that will be used for generating an OS X installer package.

Note that the panel itself is part of the postflight shell script.  NOTE 
that if you update the panel you must update that lousy script too.

The reason to do it that way is so we can be sure to put it in the right 
directory, as well to make sure the ownership is right.  Other working 
suggestions welcome.
